# Blue Marble

Our project, Blue Marble, is named after our team name, which aims to minimize the effects of global warming as much as possible. Our core focus was to save our cities from future sinkholes. While performing these solutions, a proper drainage system will be built, which will help minimize water pollution. Less dependence on underground water will ensure the use of processed fresh river water and it will act as a barrier between the increasing salinity in the river water and the rising sea level. Forestation will result in cooler weather and more rain. Every one of them is interlinked with each other and will improve the whole ecosystem. The main focus was to focus on the most dangerous threats in order to create public awareness and let people know more about NASA EONET API data available on our websites and more information about global warming. The prototype game provided on the website will let the user know the necessary steps to ensure safe and secure surroundings. The future plan is to make this game location-based, so the user will be able to see the threats around his location and should be able to react and take the necessary steps to know the results of his decisions and react accordingly.
